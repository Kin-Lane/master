<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p>Here are some of the questions I get about my platform, and these APIs. As I get more, I will add them here, to help answer your most pressing questions, without having to contact me directly.</p>

<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Who is Kin Lane?</strong> - I am the API Evangelist, an analyst and engineer who focuses exclusively on the world of APIs.</li>
	<li><strong>Why do you have APIs?</strong> - Everyone should have APIs, not just the Twitters of the world. I have APIs to help practice what I preach, and make my research open and accessible to everyone.</li>
	<li><strong>What can I build with the APIs?</strong> - That is up to you. I have APis to empower you with access to my research, what you build should benefit your world, as well as the wider API community.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Support</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>What is the best way to get support?</strong> - The best way is to <a href="https://github.com/Kin-Lane/master/issues">submit a Github issue for the master API stack</a>, or via the Github repository for each API. I try to keep API specific issues local to each API, and wider conversations via the portal.</li>
	<li><strong>Why did it take a couple days to get response?</strong> - I am a one man show, and sometimes I can get to issue immediately and sometimes it takes me time. If it is mission critical, I will make time, but otherwise I queue things up.</li>
	<li><strong>Can I email you?</strong> - Sure you can, but remember that I do not always check email each day, as sometimes I tune it out to be more productive in my research. I priotize Github issues and Tweets a little differently.</li>
	<li><strong>Can I talk to you on the phone?</strong> - I take calls on Thursday, and have open office hours. Schedule something ahead of time and I'm happy to carve ou the time.</li>
</ul>

	<li><strong>How is your code licensed?</strong> - All code I produce tends to live in Github repository, and usually post licensing within each project--which is usually Apache 2.0.</li>
	<li><strong>can I use your API designs?</strong> - All of my APIs are licensed <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC-BY-SA</a> as well using API Commons--feel free to re-use all my designs.</li>
