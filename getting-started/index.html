<p>This is my personal API platform, that I use to manage API Evangelist, and all the other projects I'm working on. This will always be my master stack, with smaller projects broken down into separate, more meaningful portals.</p>

<p>Here are the steps to get started:</p>

<ol>
	<li><a href="https://apievangelist.3scale.net/signup" target="_blank">Register for a developer account</a></li>
	<li>Visit the documentation for the API you wish to integrate with</li>
	<li>Visit the code page, and download the language library you need</li>
	<li>Import postman collections into your postman if you need to play further</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/Kin-Lane/master/issues">Submit a Github issue for the master repository</a>, or each specific API if you need help</li>
</ol>

<p>I am continuing to work on the APis, and improve the design, error codes, and underlying data models. I am also working in real-time on the supporting building blocks like documentation, roadmap, etc.</p>
<p>If there is anything I can make smoother, or left out please let me know.</p>
