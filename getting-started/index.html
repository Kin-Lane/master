<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p align="center">This is my personal API platform, that I use to manage API Evangelist. It isn't 100% ready for everyone to use, so I'm not inviting public access to everything just yet.</p>

<p>However since part of my goal with this API, is to help showcase some of the best practices, I am making sure it containers all of the essential building blocks that I prescribe to the rest of the space.</p>

<p>If you are really eager to play with it, and are willing to deal with bugs and changes while I am stabilizing, I'm happy to get you some API keys, so you can play. Just <a href="https://github.com/Kin-Lane/master/issues">submit an issue requsting access</a>.</p>

<p>To get access to the Kin Lane API Stack, all you need is API keys, they you can browse the documentation, making live calls to the API, and begin integrating with the platform.</p>

<p>To help you on-board, I've tried to provide as much information as I can about the APIs, will keep adding code samples, and other tools for integrating with the APIs I provide.</p>

<p>I've worked hard to make getting started, simple about obtaining API keys, and the API design simple so its intuitive enough to just use--let me know if there is anything I can make better.</p>
